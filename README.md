# visurando3d

## Goal of the project 

This project aims to be a free 3D visualization application for KML, KMZ, GPX files with a video creation tool for social networks.
The application could be used to track cycling, biking, hiking or running routes.

Maybe , later I will add subscription to have a personnal account to save tracks and video. 

## Roadmap

As off today there's no official roadmap;
 but I think of something like that:

o MVP : first
- A mockup that will be able to load track file and display it
- A dedicated site (ie public build)

o Beta : adding some animation on tracks

- follow Ã  track with a camera targetted to window center.
- bird view ie following the route from a few metres above, from the rear, looking ahead.

o Beta : Add track data and profile

- compute elevation +,-, speed, 
hourly (km/h) and kilometer (time/km) averages and all similar and useful data.
- Add a profile synchronised with track animation

o 1.0 : Video export

- Add an image/video tool able to make simple screenshots for social network dedicated videos (9x16, 16x9, 4x3, 1x1)
- A local database for storing personal projects
- UI to add/edit/manage tracks

o Later (to be scheduled and ordered)

- Subscriptions 
-- an external database
-- direct link to video
-- share videos to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube ...
- Other
-- tools used to import files from tracker apps (direct access to track file) 
-- manage projects (ie group of tracks)
-- ...
